= Shortest Path Algorithm


[position="center-up"]
== Insight #1

[position="center-up"]
For any given start node, we can find one shortest path to its closest neighbor.


== Insight #2

We need to expand the list of candidates to find the second shortest path.


== Insight #3

We only need to expand the search from the node that we confirmed to be a shortest path.


== Insight #4

After expanding the list of candidates we can find the shortest path to another node.


== Insight #5

Candidates must be selected relative to the start node.


== Insight #6

We are building a minimum spanning tree.


== Insight #7
We may discover multiple edges to reach a candidate but we only need to keep track of the minimal one.


== Insight #8
For a single path we can terminate at the target node as a special case.


== Insight #9

We need to record predecessors so that we can build a path result by backtracking.


== Shortest Path

* Start at the start node
* Add the start node neighbors as candidates
* Visit the closest candidate relative to the start node
* Record the predecessor to the visited node
* Add the neighbors of the visited node as candidates
* Choose the closest candidate relative to the start node to visit
* … repeat the visit / expand cycle until we reach the target node …
* Backtrack to the start node to return the path result.


== Shortest Path

* expanding the set of candidates, and
* visiting the candidate closest to the start node.


== Implementation details

* Mark the start node as visited
* Minimum total weight candidate
* Mark visisted
* Replace candidates
* Store predecessors


== Improvement #1

Use a priority queue to store the candidates


== Improvement #2

Use a heuristic to guide the search


== Guess

Cost of path = Cost so far + distance


== Benefits

* Visit candidates closer to the target first
* Still discover the minimum cost
* Early termination becomes useful


== Summary

* Expand and visit
* Use a priority queue
* Use a minimum bound guess
